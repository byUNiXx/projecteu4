 string_start_rom_58:0 "After a ruinous civil war, the Roman republic became far too unstable, resulting in Augustus declaring himself emperor.\n\nWith the power of the famous Roman legions, Rome has grown into the most powerful empire in the history of man and now, during Pax Romana our wealth and prosperity in unmatched. Despite this, the integrity of the empire is far from secured. To the east lies the Parthian Empire that rivals us in military strength and to the north, various barbarian tribes yearn for the riches of Rome. Despite this, the biggest threats may dwell within the empire, as the senate still clings to the power they had during the republic and even the powerful Roman legions are a double-edged sword, as the generals controlling those armies possess the power to overthrow the emperor if they deem it necessary."
 string_start_hnd_58:0 "The Han Dynasty has been the dominant force in asia, and controller of China proper for over 200 years. By now, many have attempted to topple it with the latest attempt being by Wang Mang, who proclaimed himself emperor of the Xin Dynasty in 9CE. However, his rule was short, as in 23CE a rebellion broke out and restored the Han Dynasty. The next few years saw some political instability, but the empire is now in a steady process of recovery. The borders of the empire are also mostly secure, as the biggest threat, the nomadic Xiongnu to the north, recently suffered from a civil war of their own greatly decreasing their strength. The empire is safe for the time being, however internal instability could always return to become a problem."
 string_start_igr_58:0 "We are the last. Over three centuries ago, our ancestors strode triumphantly across the vast, smoldering remnants of the once unbeatable Persian Empire. Under the leadership of Alexander, the greatest leader in history, it seemed Greek culture, Greek learning, and Greek civilization would rule the entire world, from the fertile lands of Europe to the deserts of Asia. We were wrong. The Empire collapsed into warring states, the strongest being the tyrannical Seleucids, who our Bactrian ancestors revolted against. Our current state was founded by the general Apollodotus, when he refused to let the Indian provinces take part in the civil wars that would eventually lead to Bactria's destruction at the hands of steppe barbarians. Now, Bactria and the Seleucid Empire are ruled by new Kushan and Parthian regimes, whose lapdogs have occupied the vast majority of our country.\n\nAs the last free Greeks in the whole world, a difficult choice faces us. Once we push the Indo-Scythians and Kushans back across the Hindu Kush, should we continue west, attempting to restore Alexander's empire and eventually liberating our lost homeland from the distant Roman tyrants now ruling it? Or should we accept that we are now Indian, and try to build a new home and power for ourselves in Asia? Either way we must act fast to occupy weak nearby states to gain a chance against the enemy hordes."
 string_start_rom_224:0 "After a ruinous civil war, the Roman republic became far too unstable, resulting in Augustus declaring himself emperor.\n\nWith the power of the famous Roman legions, Rome has grown into the most powerful empire in the history of man and now, during Pax Romana our wealth and prosperity in unmatched. Despite this, the integrity of the empire is far from secured. To the east lies the Sassanid Empire that rivals us in military strength and to the north, various barbarian tribes yearn for the riches of Rome. Despite this, the biggest threats may dwell within the empire, as the senate still clings to the power they had during the republic and even the powerful Roman legions are a double-edged sword, as the generals controlling those armies possess the power to overthrow the emperor if they deem it necessary."
 string_start_sas_224:0 "Sassanid Ardashir the First has defeated his Parthian overlord, Artabanus the Fourth. His victory broke the Parthian rule, and made the Persian Sassanid dynasty the ruling dynasty, with him on the throne. As his realm is finally ruled by a true Persian, it enters its best period in history, a golden age of Persia.\nYet, the rivals are still there. The Roman Empire to the west is still a big, civilized threat. The Empire of Kushan to the east is also a worthy, powerful rival. There are many opportunities, though. Will the new, reborn Sassanid Persia rise to the glory never seen since the days of the Achaemenid Empire, or succumb to the internal strife that is still going on after the defeat of former Parthian rulers?"
 string_start_row_395:0 "The great civilization of Rome is under attack. In the west, barbarians continue to threaten the unstable and declining country and unrest grows throughout the roman provinces as the mixture of violent cultures proves to be destructive. The country has been redivided after the death of Theodosius the I and Honorius takes the throne. With the recent adoption of Christianity, the empire tries it's best to convert the lands to the true faith. Can Honorius restore the empire to glory with his brother Arcadius of the Eastern Roman Empire, and save it from falling into heathen, uncivilized hands?"
 string_start_frk_395:0 "The Sicambri Dynasty of the Frankish tribes have created a dominant presence in Germania, and continue to unite the people for one cause. Seizing the land of the Romans, and reclaiming their lost lands is a very prestigious goal. Genobald I has already led the tribe to victory once in 388 against the Romans, what's to stop him from claiming another? Can he bring the Frankish tribes to further glory?"
 string_start_hns_395:0 "The Huns have grown exponentially in the last 50 years, with Uldin leading his horde to uniting most of Scythia. No one can look at a Hunnish horde without fainting, and no army can fight one without being shattered, or decimated completely. With an unstable Eastern Roman Empire after the death of Theodosius the First, there is surely opportunity for the Hunnish tribes. A future to look forward to. Can Uldin, and his successors, forge an everlasting state in Europe?"
 string_start_gok_637:0 "Göktürks power diminished after the independence of the Western Khanate. The Göktürk Khanate is now divided into two parts, while the Khan's eternal enemy the Tang Dynasty grows restless of our raids and from lands afar rises a new religion. Will Chebi Khan unite the great Turkish Khanate against our eternal enemy? Will the Göktürk Khanate be lost in history? or will it be an empire whose name would echo through ages to come?"
 string_start_sas_637:0 "It seems like all the holiness of Ahura Mazda has left Iran - Heathen Arabs of the desert, organized under the banner of Islam, a new, powerful religion, are ravaging Persia, defeating their armies one after another! The strife between Yazdegerd III and the nobility has reached the levels of a civil war, so no one can organize a response to the invaders. The Arab invaders are preaching Islam far and wide with their conquests. They also took the pride of Persia, their capital, Ctesiphon, and sacked it.\nDire times for the Iranian realm are already there. Will the Sassanid dynasty save what's left from the ancient Iran? Is Yazdeged the Third able to fend off the Arab wave of destruction?"
 string_start_avr_637:0 "The Avar Khaganate has migrated to Pannonia a long time ago, with their fierce horseback army of the steppes. They are capable warriors, pillaging and extracting tribute from the surrounding states. Western chronicles refer to them as "Huns", because Avar horseback warriors are as ruthless and effective as the actual tribe of Huns, who came here before them. Will the Khaganate under the leadership of Bayan expand its infulence further west? Can it mark its place in history?"
 string_start_srr_637:0 "While most of the Avar kin left their homeland to claim the steppes and the glory of pillaging their enemies, some of them stayed. They settled down and founded a kingdom of Sarir, and they got christianized, unlike their Tengrist steppe brothers. \nWith a new religion called Islam rising in the south, and expanding dangerously northwards, Kotrag might be forced to look for an alliance to secure the existence of his state, and fend off the Muslim invaders when the time comes."
 string_start_usa_1861:0 "The U.S. was engulfed in a bitter conflict over slavery ever since its founding, but the invention of cotton gin that precipitated slavery in the south combined with the urbanization of the north polarized the two regions. The two disagreed over a number of political issues, such as national railroads, tariffs, homesteads, and above all, the expansion of slavery to the western territories. The tension came to a head when Republican Presidential candidate Abraham Lincoln was elected with just 39% of the popular vote, not even appearing on the ballot in many southern states. Though he swore he had no intention of abolishing slavery in the southern states, the antebellum South pulled out of the U.S., believing secession was the only path to protecting the southern way of life.\n\nThe Union must put down the 'southern rebellion' to keep the country together, while preventing European powers from aiding the Confederates and forever dividing America in two."
 string_start_csa_1861:0 "The fire-eaters have pushed eleven former U.S. slave-states over the edge, convincing their state legislatures to back out of the United States and form the Confederate States of America. The war is a result of many factors, particularly the regional and sectional differences of the two parts of the U.S., but secession from the Union was begot primarily from a fear of the abolition of slavery.\n\nTo achieve independence and the formation of a slave empire, the Confederacy must fight a long defensive war against the militarily and technologically advanced North, while simultaneously preventing our own union of states from splintering apart from within.\n\nEven if we succeed, the Americas will be greatly weakened as a result of a divided great power, but if we fail, the traditional lifestyle of the southern U.S. will be lost forever."
 string_start_ger_1939:0 "After a disastrous defeat in WW1, Germany was crippled militarily, diplomatically, and economically. Billions in war reparations coupled with hyperinflation resulted in a severe economic depression. Desperate for change, the German people turned to a new party, the National Socialists, and its leader, Adolf Hitler, to turn things around. After seizing power and reforming Germany into a fascist dictatorship, Adolf Hitler began an aggressive campaign to turn his nation into a global empire spanning all of Europe and beyond, and used eugenics to assert that the people of Germany were ethnic Aryans, a supposed 'master race', and slowly began the mass genocide of Jews across Europe. Hitler annexed both Czechoslovakia and Austria, and the rest of the world finally drew the line at the German invasion of Poland, with Great Britain and France being the first to declare war as the second global conflict in just 20 years began.\n\nCan Germany succeed in forming the next global empire? Or will WW2 result in a defeat even worse than WW1?"
 string_start_usa_present:0 "The modern era has seen the U.S. grow to be the greatest military and economic force in the world. Consumerism thrives and popular culture permeates every facet of life. However, the rise of terrorism following the 9/11 attacks and tensions in the Middle East has spawned a new world order rife with conflict, sectionalism, nationalism, and global catastrophes such as Climate Change and World Hunger. The U.S. must work with its allies to balance world power and maintain peace across the globe in the face of various crises."
